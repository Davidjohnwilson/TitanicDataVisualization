    <h1>What were your chances of survival on the Titanic?</h1>

    <div>
      <p>Would you have survived if you were on the Titanic? Your chances were universally higher if you are a woman, and if you were also over 60, you were virtually guaranteed to survive. On the other hand, if you were a man who was also over 60 with a spouse on board, you had almost no chance to survive.
      </p>
