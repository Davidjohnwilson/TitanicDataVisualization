    <h1>What were your chances of survival on the Titanic?</h1>

    <div>
      <p>Would you have survived if you were on the Titanic? Your chances were universally higher if you are a woman, and if you were also over 60, you were virtually guaranteed to survive. On the other hand, if you were a man who was also over 60 with a spouse on board, you had almost no chance to survive. Also, interestingly, the order of survival of age groups with men is almost the exact opposite as with women: younger men had the best chance of survival, whilst older women had a better chance.
