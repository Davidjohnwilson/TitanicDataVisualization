    <h2 class='header'>What were your chances of survival on the Titanic?</h2>

    <p>
      Your chances were universally higher if you are a woman, and if you were also over 60, you were virtually guaranteed to survive. On the other hand, if you were a man who was also over 60, you had almost no chance to survive. Interestingly, the order of survival of age groups with men is almost the exact opposite as with women: younger men had the best chance of survival, whilst older women had a better chance.
